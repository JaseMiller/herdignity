# herdignity
This is a redevelopment of a custom WordPress theme for Her Dignity Network (HDN). It requires several plugins to function fully which I will describe as I go.

My preference is to require as little as possible configuration outside the theme itself, but I inherited the original theme with a complex set of plugin and javascript interactions that create confusion and risk breaking various parts of the site unnecessarily. I'm working to simplify and improve the theme here.

#plugins that seem to be required
Again, I've tried to simplify this theme by removing any dependencies on plugins wherever I could. It still appears that the following plugins are required for the theme to function optimally:

- Home Slider (a custom plugin from the original theme developer)
- Category Order and Taxonomy Terms Order
- Contact Form 7
- Categories Images
- Advanced Custom Fields
