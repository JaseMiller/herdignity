# herdignity
This is a redevelopment of a custom WordPress theme for Her Dignity Network (HDN). It requires several plugins to function fully which I will describe as I go.

My preference is to require as little as possible configuration outside the theme itself, but I inherited the original theme with a complex set of plugin and javascript interactions that create confusion and risk breaking various parts of the site unnecessarily. I'm working to simplify and improve the theme here.
